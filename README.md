***FreedomPlugin*** is a lightweight Minecraft plugin that allows you to control the world border with ease. It includes a dynamic feature to automatically expand the world border after a configurable amount of time, encouraging exploration and adventure.

**Freedom Plugin - Dynamic World Border Management**
Freedom Plugin introduces dynamic world border functionality for Minecraft servers, elevating the gameplay experience by ensuring fairness and balance among players. It allows server administrators to customize the world border's behavior, including automatic periodic expansion, transition effects, and notifications for players.
The plugin is perfect for servers that make use of datapacks or custom world generation mechanics, providing a balanced and adjustable game field for all players, limiting the advantage of looting far-away structures while others focus on mining or exploring locally.
Key Features:
- Fully configurable world border via `config.yml`.
- Automatic world border expansion based on server days.
- Configurable wait time, border size increments, and maximum size.
- Smooth animations for border changes with transition effects.
- Player notifications for transparency.
- Administrative commands to debug, restore defaults, or manually trigger updates.
- Simple `/freedom` command for managing the plugin.

Use Freedom Plugin to bring a flexible and fair way of managing player exploration in custom world setups or multiplayer scenarios!
### Usage Context:
This plugin was designed with servers in mind, particularly those that utilize datapacks that alter world generation or add structures. In these setups, having an expanding world border ensures that:
- All players progress fairly, with equal access to structures and resources as the border grows.
- Players aren't able to gain a significant advantage by looting far-off structures before others have the chance to explore.
- Gameplay remains balanced and interesting for all participants, enhancing the experience even in competitive or cooperative server settings.
